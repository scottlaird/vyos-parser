# Between 1.2.3 and 1.2.4, FRR added per-neighbor enforce-first-as option.
# Unfortunately they also removed the global enforce-first-as option,
# which broke all old configs that used to have it.
#
# To emulate the effect of the original option, we insert it in every neighbor
# if the config used to have the original global option
